  **While it is easier to analyze the data by unpivoting the raw data using power query and visualize it with power bi, I decide to present my analysis and build an interactive dashboard using only excel tools with VBA (visual Basic for applications) and macros to automate repetitive task, custom number formatting and conditional formatting, pivot tables, and excel charts.**
